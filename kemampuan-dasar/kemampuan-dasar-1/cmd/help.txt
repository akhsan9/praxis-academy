:: Remarks :
::
       Using /PURGE or /MIR on the root directory of the volume formerly caused
       robocopy to apply the requested operation on files inside the System
       Volume Information directory as well. This is no longer the case; if
       either is specified, robocopy will skip any files or directories with that
       name in the top-level source and destination directories of the copy session.

       The modified files classification applies only when both source
       and destination filesystems support change timestamps (e.g., NTFS)
       and the source and destination files have different change times but are
       otherwise the same. These files are not copied by default; specify /IM
       to include them.
